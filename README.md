This project retrieves data from the wufoo API by using an 
authenticator key that is specific to our form that was created.
This was done using Get requests. It is then supposed to show the 
different entries of people who filled out the form and print it to wufoo.txt.
For my database I have created 9 different columns for the fields entryID, firstname, 
lastname, email, website link, project topic, phone number, collab year,
and collab opportunities. I have manually entered mock data into the 
database to show that it works, but it does not take actual form entries.
What's missing from my project are automated tests that actually work.
For Sprint 3 a graphical interface of my previous database was attempted, but I did
was not succeeded. My API entries do not come through therefore making it difficult to actually see 
if the gui is working. I used the tkinter tool to build my gui. Most of the 
project does not really work just being honest.
